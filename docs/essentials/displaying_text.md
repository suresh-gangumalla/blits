# Blits - Lightning 3 App Development Framework

## Displaying Text

Besides displaying images, it is also very common to have _texts_ in an App.

Blits comes with a built-in `<Text>`-tag for displaying and styling texts in a simple and intuitive way.

```xml
<Text
  content="Hello world"
  font="ComicSans"
  size="$fontSize"
  :color="$changingColor"
/>

```
You can use the Text-tag anywhere in your template, without the need to explicitly import and register it in your Component.

### Available attributes on the Text tag

The Text-tag accepts the following attributes:

- `content` - the text to be displayed. Can be a hardcoded text, a dynamic value, or a reactive value
- `font` - the font family, defaults to `sans-serif`, or the default font specified in the launch settings
- `size`  - the font size, defaults to `32`
- `color` - the color to display for the text, defaults to `white` and can be any of the supported Blits color formats (HTML, hexadecimal or rgb(a))
- `letterspacing` - letterspacing in pixels, defaults to `0`
- `align` - the alignment of the text, can be `left`, `right`, or `center`, defaults to `left`. Centering text and aligning text to the right requires the `wordwrap` attribute to be set as well.
- `wordwrap` - the max length of a line of text in pixels, words surpassing this length will be broken and wrapped onto the next line. This attribute is required when aligning center or right
- `maxlines` - maximum number of lines that will be displayed
- `maxheight` - maximum height of a text block, lines that don't fit within this height will not be displayed
- `lineheight` - the spacing between lines in pixels
- `contain` - the strategy for containing text within the bounds, can be `none` (default), `width`, or `both`. In most cases, the value of this attribute will automatically be set by Blits, based on the other specified attributes
- `textoverflow` - the suffix to be added when text is cropped due to bounds limits, defaults to `...`


### SDF and Canvas2d

Compared to Lightning 2, texts have improved a lot in Lightning 3, thanks to the SDF (Signed Distance Field) Text renderer.

With the SDF text renderer, texts appear a lot _sharper_ on screen. The SDF technique also allows for better scaling of texts, without them becoming blurry - a well-known painpoint in Lightning 2 Apps.

 In general, it's recommended to use the SDF text renderer, but Lightning 3 still has a Canvas2d text renderer as a backup, and you can use both text renderers within the same App.

### Using custom fonts

The `font`-attribute on the `<Text>`-tag is used to define which font family should be used for a certain piece of text.

When you create a new Blits app using the available [getting started boilerplate](../getting_started/getting_started.md) you'll be able to use the `lato` (Lato regular) and `raleway` (Raleway ExtraBold) fonts out of the box.

But of course, you can also use any custom font that you want, to give your App the unique look and feel that fits with the design.

Adding is custom font to a Blits App is quite straightforward. First, you'll need to place a `.ttf` version of your font in the `public` folder (i.e. `public/fonts/comic-sans.ttf`).

Then you'll need to register the custom font in the Launch settings of your app (in `src/index.js`). The `fonts`-key in the settings is an `Array` that specifies all available fonts in your App.

Just add a new font object with the necessary details:

```js
  fonts: [
    // ...
    {
      family: 'ComicSans', // the font name used in your App
      type: 'msdf', // type of text renderer to use (msdf or web)
      file: 'fonts/Comic-Sans.ttf', // location of the ttf file
    },
    // ..
  ],
  ```

From this moment on you'll be able to use the font `ComicSans` anywhere in your App:

```xml
<Text font="ComicSans" content="I'm Comic Sans font!" />
```
